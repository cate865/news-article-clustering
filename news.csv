1,PHOTOS: Kagame receives credentials from 14 envoys,https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/4706/news/rwanda/the-new-times-launches-new-podcast,"According to The Global Gender Gap Report, in 2021, Rwanda moved up from ninth place to seventh in the world’s top 10 gender-equal societies. In 2008, the Chamber of Deputies – the lower house – was the first elected national parliament where women were the majority, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU). Among others, the proportion of lawmakers who are women in Rwanda is at 61.25 per cent today, way above the global average of 26.4 per cent. ALSO READ: Kigali declaration outlines ‘actions to achieve gender equality in Parliaments’ Rwanda has been at the top of the IPU’s monthly ranking of women in national parliaments for years. Despite the gains made in this and other areas of the country’s life towards gender equality, findings continue to show that a long journey has to be made to fully achieve gender equality in the country. Nonetheless, the country, or nation, has come a long way. Women weren&#039;t always treated fairly. They were not allowed, for example, to do certain things. Here are just five things Rwandan women could not do 50, or so, years ago. 1. Eating chicken or goat meat Shocked? On my part when I learned about it, I was surprised. It never occurred to me that one had to be a certain gender in order to enjoy a dish such as chicken or goat meat. Meat from goats is called chevon, by the way. In Rwandan cultural norms it was said that chicken or goat meat was a man’s dish. Rwandan women were advised to avoid goat meat. And according to old cultural belief, women or girls who ate goat meat would grow beards. 2. Building houses or climbing trees Due to the outfits or attires worn by Rwandan women in the past, they were not allowed to climb trees or build houses. This was seen as taboo when women were building or climbing trees because they exposed their bodies when doing so. As such, till this day, climbing trees is still engraved as something not very feminine, or ladylike. 3. Beating drums Rwandan women would do other forms of entertainment such as singing or dancing. They could dance and sing with men. However, when it came to beating the drums, only men were allowed. The Intore dance, the most popular traditional dance in Rwanda is performed in three forms including the ballet, or gushayaya, often performed by women. There is also the heroes&#039; dance performed by men and, lastly, the drums that used to be performed by men. But now, women drumming is no longer taboo in modern Rwanda since women rose above the stereotypes and are drumming beautifully next to their male counterparts. 4. Whistling Women who whistled were regarded as ill-mannered which resulted in them being disrespected if they were caught whistling. In Rwandan culture, it was believed that whistling was not feminine. People considered it undignified when a female whistled. ALSO READ: Kagame: Gender equality is not just a women’s issue 5. Milking cows Milking a cow was considered a man’s job in Rwandan culture. When the women were single and did not have a husband to milk the cows they would ask for assistance from their neighbors or other male figures present in their lives. It was believed that when milking a cow the position or sitting posture a lady used did not dignify women due to the attires they wore in the past. This is the reason why they were not allowed to milk cows."
2,"Starlink internet is fast and affordable, ICT Minister says",https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/4909/news/international/baby-girl-born-under-rubble-of-earthquake-in-syria,"Rwanda Investigation Bureau (RIB) has warned the public against working with over 10 companies that are allegedly committing white-collar crimes. White-collar crimes refer to financially motivated, nonviolent or non-directly violent crimes committed by individuals, businesses and government professionals. They include wage theft, fraud, bribery, insider trading, labour racketeering, embezzlement, cybercrime, copyright infringement, money laundering, identity theft, forgery and others. The crimes also include Ponzi schemes, a form of fraud that lures investors and pays profits to earlier investors with funds from more recent investors. According to Thierry Murangira, the RIB spokesperson said that white-collar crimes are on the rise and named some of the companies behind. “There is a rising trend of white-collar crimes which are non-violent from violent crimes. People are stealing money and property in different deceitful ways. Recently we received complaints about Tomtranfers company that swindled cars from clients,” he said. Case file of Tomtransfers has been submitted to Prosecution on December 5, 2022, he said. Since July last year, RIB said it has received over 100 cases suing Tom Transfers Company. “This is not the only case of white-collar crimes,” he said, citing a company called Supermarketings Global Ltd that was recently suspended. The company and others were found to often require new members/recruits to pay a fixed amount of money to the scheme’s promoters often guised as a membership fee with the promise to receive a portion of new entrants’ fees. In 2019, RIB arrested the CEO of Supermarketings Global Ltd for involvement in illegal cryptocurrency trade “There is also Cavallon Ltd, BITSEC, and Gold Planning Artificial Intelligence, Binance, Kigali Analytics Trade with Diana Penda Africa, P & A Group represented by a person known as Shema among others that are using many tricks t swindle from people by pledging huge returns. Some include buying crypto currency, buying shares, online forex trading,” Murangira said. Murangira said that most of the companies are registered in RDB but their operations ‘are totally different from the businesses they registered.’ “For instance Cavallon Ltd registered to do advertising activities. They were doing activities that are totally different. People should invest in trusted companies and must be careful before investing. On January 7, seven people filed the complaint to RIB suing three people behind Gold Planning Artificial Intelligence which urges people to invest money in buying robots online saying it makes profits depending on their value. Two were arrested and one is still on the run,” he said. Pyramid schemes National Bank of Rwanda (BNR) has been warning Rwandans against working with unlicensed businesses involved in pyramid schemes. BNR warned against working with 3 Friends System Group Ltd, Onecoin or Kwakoo, among others, whose scams take the form of active pyramid schemes, multiple level marketing or cryptocurrency issuance through fake initial coin offering (cryptoscam)."
3,Rwandans in US host prayer banquet for country,https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/4808/news/security/rising-riots-in-goma-hinder-cross-border-trade,"Rwanda has issued a notice of intent to “modify” the 4G LTE wholesale monopoly license granted to Korea Telecom Rwanda Networks (KTRN), a move that would allow for other companies to participate in the wholesale of 4G internet. A notice by Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Authority (RURA) served to KTRN has been published in the official gazette informing the latter about the modification of the license. ALSO READ: KTRN invests $10m in 4G network upgrade Among the reasons for the modification is the implementation of the new National Broadband Policy and Strategy adopted by the government in October 2022, which aims at enhancing competition to accelerate the access and adoption of broadband mobile services for all. The policy also aims at liberalizing technology deployments and wireless access spectrum assignments to ensure that all operators have the ability to deploy such advanced broadband services. Equally important, the policy notes, is supporting continued competition in the national fiber backhaul market, ensuring that all providers can continue investing to further extend their networks, including bringing fiber closer to end users. The New Times understands that the proposed license modification, among others, aims at adjusting the provisions in KTRN’s license that designate the company as a dominant organization over the wholesale of mobile broadband access services, intercity Broadband transport services, and international broadband transport services to border international gateways. It also looks to make amendments of the license to remove references imposing technology restrictions on any other licensed operator and to make the license technology-neutral, in addition to removing references that “are no longer” required, The new National Broadband Policy and Strategy proposes the redesigning of the market structure, shifting from service-based competition, and allowing for the deployment of advanced networks and services. “Thus, the implementation of the new National Broadband Policy and Strategy and KTRN License for network service provision, warrants the removal of the regulatory barriers that prevent other Telecom Operators from deployment of the latest available technology,” a statement from RURA reads in part. “RURA is therefore aiming to ensure that all licenses are technology neutral and contain provisions that allow other Mobile Network Operators to deploy 4G and beyond technologies to provide greater network capacity and faster connectivity across the national mobile networks,” the statement added. The modification of KTRN license for network service provision license, is expected to lead to a new telecommunication local market structure, as well as positively affect the business of 4G Retailers licensees who are currently operating under agreement with KTRN as the only wholesaler of 4G LTE. More about the KTRN-Rwanda deal In 2013, the government of Rwanda and Korean Telecom (KT) signed a 25-year deal to launch 4G wholesale in the country—a very unique business model in the world at that time. KTRN is a joint venture between Korea Telecom — with a 51 per cent stake — and the government, which owns a 49 per cent stake. Under the partnership, Korea Telecom was to offer its expertise and make a cash injection of around $140 million, while the government’s equity investment included its national fiber optic network assets, spectrum and a wholesale-only operator license of 25 years. KTRN is said to have been making losses, with figures showing the company made a $25.1 million loss in 2018 (figures released by the United States Securities and Exchanges Commission)."

The combined group will have over 3,900 service stations and more than two billion litres of storage capacity across 27 African countries.

Stan Mittelman, CEO of Vivo Energy said the company’s focus has been to invest in growing its business, and it has doubled the network size since its formation in 2011. “Four years ago, we acquired the Engen business in nine African markets, and have since worked to enhance and develop these. Vitol’s full acquisition of Vivo Energy last year brings more opportunities to grow even faster.” “The completion of this transaction, which reunites the Engen brand across Africa, will be a step change in our growth and represents a significant commitment to the South African market whilst enhancing Vivo Energy’s portfolio in other important markets,” he added. Seelan Naidoo, Managing Director and CEO of Engen said this provides an opportunity for Engen to build on its market leading position in South Africa and a number of southern African countries. “It allows us to leverage our strong brand equity, leading retail footprint, extensive supply chain capability and unrivalled customer service to be a leading contributor to Vivo Energy and Vitol’s ambition to build a stronger and more successful Pan-African energy champion.” “Engen is excited to become part of the enlarged business and this will set up our business to be stronger and more successful than ever before,” he added. Phuthuma Nhleko, Chairman and Co-founder of Phembani Group said: “The Phembani Group is proud to have been a long-term shareholder in Engen since 1999, partnering with Petronas and helping to grow Engen into a valuable South African corporate citizen, meeting the needs of millions of ordinary South Africans. “We are pleased to partner with Vivo Energy in the next phase of Engen’s growth. We are confident that together we will support Engen’s continued growth, enabling it to realise its vision,” he noted. Chris Bake, Chair of Vivo Energy said Vivo Energy has been a success story since its inception. It has grown consistently, both organically and by investing in modern quality assets. “It has a highly professional and capable management team with a deep understanding of Africa’s unique energy requirements. Engen is South Africa’s market-leader and this powerful combination will benefit customers in South Africa and across the continent.” The transaction is currently pending regulatory approvals and fulfilment of conditions precedent. Engen is the clear market leader in South Africa and has around 1,300 service stations across seven African countries.

This was just over a day after regional leaders met in Bujumbura, Burundi to try to calm tensions in eastern DR Congo. Congolese citizens were seen near the border, in the Goma side, chastising both the UN peacekeeping force, MONUSCO, and the East African Community Regional Force (EACRF). ALSO READ: Kagame: ‘Congo leaders cannot make Rwanda the scapegoat’ According to reports from across the border, the riots also targeted Rwandans living in Goma and Kinyarwanda speaking Congolese, accusing them of collaborating with M23, a rebel group operating in the east of DR Congo. The demonstrators in Goma erected road barricades, and forced businesses to close as they called for the departure of the EAC regional force from the country, accusing them of not fighting the M23 rebels. The rebels recently gained significant ground against the Congolese military and its militia coalition involving groups such as the Rwandan genocidal militia, FDLR. The latter was formed by remnants of the masterminds of the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda. According to a few Congolese nationals who crossed into Rwanda, the riots which intensified Monday afternoon, are supposed to last between five and six days. It is reported that Lutte Pour Le Changement (LUCHA), a group based in Goma, organised the protests, urging traders to suspend work on Monday to join the demonstrations. In Goma, youths vandalised some shops and looted. Samuel Semagene, an elderly father of nine from the Birere suburb of Goma crossed the border to Rwanda on Monday morning at around 6:00am for his regular retail vegetable business errands. He said riots in his hometown affected cross-border trade. “We are brothers and sisters. Clearly, right now I am sitting here in the market, and working with our Rwandan colleagues. There is no need for violence,” Semagene told The New Times. Ismael Mwamba, another Congolese businessman who lives and works in Rwanda, was stranded at Rubavu Cross Border Market in the early morning hours, fearful of what his compatriots could do to him once they saw him entering his country, from Rwanda. “When unrest broke out in Goma, Rwandans were the most targeted. They are victimized a lot,” he said, fearing that if he crossed to the other side, an angry mob would not spare him. Despite the fact that the borders are officially, open, peace loving Congolese and Rwandans along the common border are troubled by the rising tide of violence coming from the DR Congo side. The Executive Secretary of Gisenyi Sector, Jean Bosco Tuyishime, warned people to be careful and avoid unnecessary movements owing to the volatility of the situation across the border. “We urge residents to be careful. The situation in Goma is unpredictable. People should avoid unnecessary crossing until normalcy returns,” he told The New Times. According to data from the District, about 10,000 people at present cross the Petite Barrière Border Post, every day, compared to the 50,000 people that crossed the border before the Covid-19 pandemic."
14,Heroism is about making good choices - Governor Habitegeko,https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/4769/news/rwanda/victims-of-rusororo-maize-drier-accident-revealed,"The Rwandan community living in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain on February 3, tipped on heroism as they convened for a virtual gathering in honour of National Heroes Day. Officials used the opportunity to call upon the community to be torchbearers of heroic values and strive for Rwanda’s development. Rwanda’s ambassador to the UAE, Emmanuel Hategeka, urged the audience to spare no efforts in preserving the legacy of Rwanda’s heroes. “Heroic values of integrity, patriotism, sacrifice, and humanity should be your attributes in whatever you do and wherever you are. You should spare no efforts in building the Rwanda we want, and preserving the national image through business and new skills,” said Hategeka, who is also Rwanda’s non-resident ambassador to Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. He tasked the youth to own Rwanda’s future, noting that their contribution should start today through good attitudes and activities. “Our youth should understand that Rwanda’s future is in their hands and that being a hero starts today, not tomorrow. The heroes who liberated the country and children of Nyange set a good example that heroism doesn’t depend on age,” Hategeka explained. Fight against false narratives The ambassador also called for a fight against false narratives. “You should not stay silent when ill-intentioned people disseminate false narratives that seek to tarnish the image of Rwanda and its leaders. You have to come out and tell the truth because you better know your country with tangible facts,” he noted. Deo Nkusi, the executive secretary of the Chancellery for Heroes, National Orders and Decorations of Honour, reflected on all attributes of Rwandan heroes through generations and told the community that it is their task to uphold and be inspired by the legacy of national heroes. “You should emulate the good values that we find in all our heroes. Be good Rwandans in countries of residence, promote our cultural dos, and avoid don’ts. Acquire wealth, new skills, and good seeds for your country, Rwanda. Learn good manners and leave behind bad habits. Earn, save, and come back to build your country,” he said. National Heroes day is observed on February 1 in Rwanda, but the Rwandan community living abroad organises celebrations throughout February."

17,Baby girl born under rubble of earthquake in Syria,https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/4731/news/technology/rwanda-intends-to-take-away-4g-monopoly-from-ktrn,"Satellite-based internet provided by Starlink, is about three times faster than the available products on the Rwandan market at almost the same price, which make it relatively affordable, according to the Minister of ICT and Innovation, Paula Ingabire. The Minister made the remarks while responding to a question from MP Frank Habineza on whether the Starlink internet will be affordable, during the plenary session of the Chamber of Deputies in which she was providing answers to issues affecting the ICT sector. On February 6, The New Times published an article in which the Rwanda Space Agency (RSA) announced that it had issued a license to Starlink, satellite internet constellation, to operate in the country, with its operations due to begin in the first quarter of 2023. Starlink is operated by SpaceX, a spacecraft manufacturing company founded by American billionaire Elon Musk. READ ALSO: Elon Musk’s Starlink to launch high-speed internet in Rwanda Information from RSA indicates that Starlink’s services are expected to increase the level of broadband competitiveness in the country as the end-user services will cost Rwf48,000 for a bandwidth of up to 150 Mbps, while for the enterprises the bandwidth can go up to 350 Mbps. According to Ken&#039;s Tech Tips, a UK&#039;s guide to mobile technology and broadband, since 2005, with a 150Mbps connection, you can download files fairly quickly. For instance, it indicated, a music album will download in around five seconds and a HD-quality movie will download in about four minutes. Browsing the internet and receiving emails should be near-instantaneous on a 150Mbps connection. Also, it indicated, with such internet connection, you can make video calls, listen to music and watch video online on multiple devices at the same time. Referring to the information from RSA, MP Habineza said that Rwf48,000 a month for the 150 Mbps internet speed per second, would be a high cost for many Rwandans. “You realise that, though we will get high speed internet, the prices will still be high such that it would be difficult for people to access it,” he said. Speaking to The New Times, Habineza proposed that such a cost be lowered for the sake of internet affordability. “I propose that the Starlink internet price should be priced a lower price than that of the available products on the market,” he told The New Times, suggesting that it should be somewhere between Rwf20,000 and Rwf30,000 per month, for it to be relatively affordable to Rwandans. High capacity and affordability Responding to MP Habineza’s query, Minister Ingabire said that compared to the capacity that is being provided and the available prices, “it is obvious that the capacity that is provided by Starlink is very high where it can be between two or three times faster.” “And when you look at the cost, based on the output that is a half or a third of the capacity that Starlink provides, you realise that its cost is very low than the available products,” she pointed out. “So, considering the services that are offered currently, we find that the Starlink price is very good, given the capacity it is providing us which is higher than the already available packages,” she indicated. Meanwhile, she said that the internet cost might be high for one household that needs such a service; but pointed out that its capacity might, usually, not be needed by a household. “As it is a capacity that might be needed by a health facility, a market where there are many people who can benefit from it, schools or public entities, it means that if you look at the number of people who can benefit from such economies of scale versus the cost, it is more cost-effective,” she said. MP Francis Karemera said that the fact that Starlink will provide high speed internet through the use of satellite, “it means that it will do it effectively, and the internet would be affordable”, calling for prioritising school connection to such internet to support education. “But, if this internet of Starlink has a footprint coverage for the entire country, and as its prices are affordable ... we would like the Minister to help us so that the connectivity starts with schools that are not connected, or those that are connected but do not have means to pay for it,” he said. Ingabire said that “Starlink services come to fill the need and gap of [internet] connectivity.”"

Convened in Washington D.C, the event brought together Rwandans and people from various nations, including the United States, Canada, Burundi, Burkina Faso, Gabon, and beyond who took part in activities including praise and worship as well as Rwandan cultural performances. This year’s theme came from Isaiah 62:1-2: “And the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth. And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness. And call kings thy glory. And thou shalt be called by da new name, which the mouth of the Lord shall name.” Apostle Mignone Alice Kabera, one of the keynote speakers, emphasised the significance of rededicating the country to God and the impact Christians can have on their communities and the country by coming together in support of their leaders. She drew upon the example of Aaron and Hur in the Bible (Exodus 17:12) to emphasise the responsibility of good people and the importance of supporting leaders. The ambassador of Rwanda in Washington D.C. Mathilde Mukantabana referenced Psalm 29:11, acknowledging the mighty presence of the Lord in providing strength and peace to his people. She also noted the transformation of Rwanda and how it continues to be blessed with fortitude and serenity. Adding, “Your prayers lend support to the vision of the nation, acting like a tailwind that propels its efforts forward [...] ensuring its steadfastness and resilience.” The High Commissioner of Rwanda to Ghana, Dr Aissa Kirabo Kacyira, drew on the remarks of President Paul Kagame during the recent National Prayer Breakfast held in Kigali and emphasised the importance of having a burden for one’s country to be a good patriot and serve it better. She lauded the unity of the Rwandan community in the United States and called for it to be upheld. “We must build in the same spirit of unity fighting against anything that could ever again divide us,” she added. The Chairman of Rwanda Leaders Fellowship, Moses Ndahiro, thanked like-minded organisations for their efforts in advancing God’s kingdom in Rwanda. He praised their generosity in providing clean water to needy families and encouraged them to do more. Ambassador Charles and Rosette Murigande dedicated the leadership and people of Rwanda to God and issued a call to action for all attendees, urging them to dedicate their works to God to be able to carry out their responsibilities with greater purpose, guidance, and strength. Antoinette Kanyabutembo, the founder of the Rwanda Prayer Banquet-USA, conveyed heartfelt gratitude to all attendees for their unwavering support, presence, and contributions. She implored the crowd to remain steadfast in their prayers for the greater good of Rwanda and to stay united."

ALSO READ: Rwanda files to acquire over 300,000 satellites Rwanda is the fourth country in Africa to issue a license to Starlink after Mozambique, Nigeria and Malawi. Prior to licensing, Rwanda was among a few countries given the opportunity to test Starlink connectivity in Africa. In tests conducted at different points of the country, Starlink speed reached up to 150 Mbps with a very low latency of 20 to 40 milliseconds (ms). According to the RSA, the Starlink technology will significantly boost the capability to improve internet access in remote and rural areas where traditional wireless, cable and fiber-optic infrastructure is often difficult to deploy. Ngabo said the licence given to Starlink cleared the way for the deployment of satellite broadband internet services in Rwanda.

Additionally, it could greatly benefit unserved areas like national parks, he said. The national space agency confirmed that the satellite broadband is not intended to replace existing internet service providers but rather to complement and enhance their services by providing coverage in areas where traditional infrastructure is lacking. The satellite internet can also serve as a backup option in case of failures or outages in the primary network, Ngabo said. He added that it will help ensure that internet access is reliable and widely available throughout the country. Paula Ingabire, Minister of ICT and Innovation, said that this license aligns with the recent National Broadband Policy and Strategy that emphasizes the objective to grow the number of players that will drive the reach and diversity of affordable, quality broadband services. We are confident that the high speed and low latency of the service will greatly benefit both citizens and businesses,” Ingabire told The New Times. “We look forward to seeing the positive impact it will have on the country&#039;s competitiveness in the global digital economy, she said. The RSA boss noted that the space agency will continue working with satellite broadband internet providers to ensure competitive prices for the customers. He added that the services are expected to increase the level of broadband competitiveness in the country as the end-user services will cost RWF48,000 for a bandwidth of up to 150 Mbps, while for the enterprises the bandwidth can go up to 350 Mbps."

In Turkey, over 80 hours after the quake hit, 16-year-old Melda Adtas was pulled out alive, leaving her overjoyed father in tears and the grieving nation cheering a rare piece of good news after Monday’s 7.8-magnitude tremor. “My dear, my dear!” the father called out as rescuers pulled the teen out of the rubble of a house in Antakya, a city in one of the most affected provinces, Hatay. It took rescue workers five hours to save her life after neighbours who had heard sounds from the splintered walls raised the alarm. When rescuers discovered Melda, she was stuck under a wall that had collapsed."

ALSO READ: Six things you should know about new anti-corruption committee in judiciary “Over the last five years since when RIB was established, about 80 staff members have been sacked over taking bribes,” Jeannot Ruhunga, RIB Secretary General, told journalists on Tuesday. “When corrupt workers are sacked, it should serve as a warning to the other staff members that our policy is zero tolerance when it comes to corruption.” ALSO READ: Most corrupt Rwandan institutions named Ruhunga added that staff members caught taking bribes or involved in corruption will be prosecuted and tried in courts of law, adding that tighter disciplinary measures are already in place. “Even if not found guilty by court, we will sack the corrupt worker if circumstantial evidence proves that he or she took the bribe,” he said. ALSO READ: Over 200 Police officers fired Disciplinary sanctions include suspension of pay for the workers involved in other professional misconduct, apart from corruption. Emmanuel Ugirasebuja, the Minister of Justice, who attended the general assembly, said that RIB should be a corruption-free institution. “Measures need to be taken to ensure that corruption is prevented. There also have to be strong and robust measures for an institution like RIB to get rid of the bad apples,” Ugirashebuja said. “If there is corruption in this institution, the entire justice system is affected because justice delivery starts with investigations, before it gets to the courts.” In 2022, Rwanda was ranked the fourth least corrupt country in Africa, by Transparency International."

Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Authority (RURA) seeks to address these concerns in a statement they will release soon. ALSO READ: Motorcycle smart metres to be re-introduced The initiative has been suspended on different occasions over several issues, like faulty metres for example. Below are five concerns: ALSO READ: Will mandatory use of smart meters finally picks up? 1. Fee issue Passengers and motorcyclists have raised the issue of being overcharged and riders say that with the continuous increase in fuel price, the metre fee has never been revised. On the other hand, passengers also claim that the expense for some trips is too high. Previously, the fare price for the first two kilometres was Rwf400 and Rwf117 per kilometre for the rest of the journey. Beyond 40 kilometres, the tariff rose to Rwf205. 2. Network issues Another concern is poor connection; as RURA plans the re-introduction of mandatory smart metres use, some are still facing network issues. Riders say that poor internet connection sometimes leads to errors in the amount of money passengers have to pay, yet after that, it becomes hard to link the fee and distance already travelled. 3. The commission fees There is a fee of 10 per cent of their daily income. RURA announced a reduction a few years back, but the new fee is still unknown. It is still an issue for riders to pay that amount on a daily income as they have to pay for the gadgets. 4. Lack of awareness Another issue that hinders the use of smart metres is user mentality where some choose not to use them because they don’t know enough about them. As they are being reintroduced, people are wondering how and what has been changed this time around—if there has been a campaign to give insights into why people should use them. 5. Riders refuse to use metres With guidelines yet to be revealed, passengers are wondering how riders who stubbornly refuse to use the metres will be held accountable—many still don’t see the need to use them. According to RURA data, in the City of Kigali, 23,000 motorcyclists have smart metres and the installation process is still ongoing."

The alleged serial killer was arrested on February 3, with three handsets belonging to three victims killed including Leonce Nshimiyimana, Vedaste Gafaranga and Gideon Nyakabanda. Police officials said the accused had confessed to murdering four guards in the last two months, while the other two that he had attempted to kill survived with severe injuries. Hafashimana who is currently held at Kigali metropolitan police told the media during his parading that he used machetes to hack his victims. “I killed four people and the other two survived,” the 34-year old Hafashimana said. He added: “There was no other interest, I only targeted sleeping security guards.” He claims to have committed his first murder three months ago. “For theft. I had a couple of companions, but I always committed murder alone,” he said. Hafashimana’s arrest follows reports on four murder cases and two far-reaching injuries in different areas of the capital. Two of the victims were killed in a gruesome manner. Hafashimana beheaded them and disposed the heads far away from the body, leaving residents shocked and gripped in fear. Vedaste Hagenimana, who is left half blind after the assailant attempted to behead him, pleaded for support, citing that his body still bears pain from the incident. “He found us sleeping, and hacked us with a machete. We suddenly cried out for help from the neighbours,” said Hagenimana. Hagenimana survived alongside Filimini Nzabagerageza, whose arm was cut off by Hafashimana. The survivors were rushed to Kanombe Military Hospital, and according to Police, are gradually recovering. Hafashimana said that the last person he killed was Leonce Nshimiyimana who had just released from Nyarugenge prison. The latter was beheaded while they were sleeping in a bush waiting to carry out housebreaking in Rusororo sector. Hafashimana said that after beheading Nshimiyimana he took his head and dumped it in a swamp connecting Rusororo and Masaka sectors. He added that he also dumped the head of one street boy identified as Matayo, in Rwampala in a water channel that flows to Nyabarongo river. Hafashimana has taken investigators to all the crime scenes where killed or dumped his victims’ heads. Addressing the media, Police spokesperson CP John Bosco Kabera said: “Police was able to arrest him following intensive investigations. The suspect has since confessed and his confessions correlate with the reported murder and serious assault cases.” He added: “Going forward, the suspect will be handed over to authorities in charge of further and thorough investigation to be able to handle this case.” Police is to hand Hafashimana to Rwanda Investigation Bureau for further investigation and case processing. Hafashimana hails from Ngororero district. He first came to Kigali in 2012 searching for a job and immediately embarked on robberies. He was mainly involved in housebreaking robberies."
29,Rising riots in Goma hinder cross-border trade,https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/4900/news/technology/starlink-internet-is-fast-and-affordable-ict-minister-says,"In a big way, the May 5, 2014 headline “Agathe Uwiringiyimana: A heroine unfortunate to have lived in evil era,” says it all. Uwiringiyimana, the first female Prime Minister in Rwanda’s history, is one of Rwanda&#039;s leading lights who exemplified heroism in her self-sacrificing fight against the regime that perpetrated the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi. She served as Prime Minister from July 17, 1993, to the time of her untimely death, in April 1994. Uwiringiyimana married Ignace Barahira in 1976. The couple was blessed with five children, four boys and a girl. Before becoming Prime Minister, she served as Minister of Education. She strongly advocated for equal rights among students, and for the rights of women in addition to spearheading the fight against divisionism. Her last born, a boy, was merely three years old when the parents were tortured and assassinated by members of the genocidal regime’s presidential guard. Fortunately, the children survived. Marie-Christine Lussi Umuhoza, who was 15 when her parents were assassinated, lives in Switzerland. She is scheduled to speak, along with other Rwandans in the diaspora, at a round table event themed: “L&#039;héroïsme des Rwandais, notre dignité [Rwandans’ heroism, our dignity]” in Geneva, on February 4. A day before Heroes Day, Umuhoza told The New Times that: “I am proud that Rwandans recognize her [Uwiringiyimana] commitment and determination to the detriment of her life for equal opportunities in education, women&#039;s rights and unity.” How has her late mother inspired her? “I try to educate my children with respect for life and others. To have my own [good] judgment without following the ideas of others.” Umuhoza stressed that Uwiringiyimana “is my mother before becoming prime minister and national hero!” It is hard to appreciate her mother’s sacrifice, she acknowledged. “It’s hard to appreciate her personal sacrifice! I was 15 [years old] in 1994. She had already received several death threats. As a child, I did not want to lose my mother.” On the night of April 6 to 7, 1994, following the downing of a Falcon 50 plane carrying President Juvenal Habyarimana, the Interahamwe and soldiers of the presidential guard began to set up roadblocks in many parts of Kigali, and killing the Tutsi. The massacres coordinated by the state machinery quickly spread all over the country. In an effort to eliminate politicians who did not support Habyarimana&#039;s government and the Genocide plot, on April 7, Uwiringiyimana, and several others, were assassinated. Uwiringiyimana knew her life was in danger British journalist Linda Melvern’s book, A People Betrayed: The Role of the West in Rwanda’s Genocide, published in 2000, gives what the author said is “a fuller account of the murder.” Melvern’s book also tells more about a courageous, patriotic and self-sacrificing Uwiringiyimana. A section of the book reads: “In March 1994 Agathe Uwiringiyimana had made one last and desperate appeal for her country. She was thirty-eight years-old, a former chemistry teacher, the prime minister of a government that in accordance with the Arusha peace agreement was planned to last thirty-seven days. In a wide-ranging interview with a Belgian journalist Prime Minister Uwiringiyimana had addressed her desperate remarks to the UN Security Council. Even as early as March the Council was actively discussing the closure of [the] UN mission for Rwanda. “In her interview Uwiringiyimana explained the reality. There were extremists actively manipulating ethnic differences to sow confusion and division. “If we are abandoned the Rwandan people will be left to their fate ...What will happen? ... This is not the moment for pulling out,” she pleaded. ‘Extremists will always be wrong, whatever their ethnic origins.’ “Uwiringiyimana knew her life was in danger. She had openly blamed the president for the continual delays in the peace process and for having engineered the divisions destroying the opposition parties. She had questioned why weapons were being issued to civilians. “Her entire political career had seen constant threats, and she had been continually at risk. When in 1992 as minister of education she had tried to put an end to the quota system for Tutsi in schools she had been attacked in her home by armed men and some days later three thousand women had demonstrated in Kigali in her support. Increasingly portrayed as an ‘accomplice to the Tutsi enemy’ “The announcers on RTLM called for her assassination on 26 November 1993, and she was increasingly portrayed as an ‘accomplice to the Tutsi enemy’. A few months later, in March 1994 she was characterized in Hutu Power propaganda in animalistic terms, for example as a rat eating money.” The extremist newspaper, Kangura, published a caricature in which Uwiringiyimana, and the Minister of Finance, Marc Rugenera, appeared in the guise of rats. They were persecuted because they were members of the MDR and the PSD, respectively, parties not aligned with the Hutu Power party of extremists who planned the genocide. ALSO READ: How hate media fueled Genocide against Tutsi In the same picture also appeared a man armed with a cudgel, commonly called Nta mpongano y’umwanzi, literally No mercy on the enemy, and ready to use it to beat these two people. The cudgel was one of the weapons which the killers used to cruelly kill their victims during the genocide. “Scheduled for assassination on April 7, and while her killers closed in, Prime Minister Uwiringiyimana took flight at 8.20 am with her husband and her five children, the youngest three years old and the children still in their pyjamas. That night she had spoken with Tito Rutaremara when she told him she thought she would be killed,” the account in Melvern’s book noted. “She was murdered later that morning,” Melvern wrote. She stood for the truth, no matter what Dafroza Gauthier, Uwiringiyimana’s former classmate at Lycée Notre Dame de Citeaux, secondary school in Kigali, recalls how Uwiringiyimana was a very smart girl. “She especially did very well in mathematics. We were young [but] I never saw any politician in her, then. I think it was, perhaps, just inside her because even when we were on the bus going home to Butare, I never heard her talk about politics. I think her bravery showed when, later, she started seeing how the country was changing in line with the policies of Habyarimana and his followers,” Dafroza said. “I think she never wanted to see her country continuously going to waste. She became so brave and stood her ground against bad leaders who were opposed to the Arusha Accords. She stood for the truth, no matter what.” In a different way, Dafroza too, as well as her partner, Alain Gauthier, continues to push through with their risky pursuit of tracking down Genocide suspects. The couple has dedicated a lot of time and resources to pursuing Genocide suspects sunbathing in French cities without a bother to the horrors their crimes in 1994 caused Rwandans."

In an exclusive interview with The New Time, on Thursday, February 9, Ngabo disclosed that he “has bigger plans to make Bigogwe an attractive tourism destination” with various activities.

In Rwandan culture, the cow is a sign of several things including partnership, collaboration and togetherness. Cows are a sign of riches and friendship when given as gifts. They are used as dowry and referenced in traditional dances, among other things. Ngabo said he plans to bring Inyambo cows to Bigogwe, for the very first time.

Ibere rya Bigogwe became famous a few years ago when Karegeya took to social media publicising the project and the brand ‘Visit Bigogwe’. His publicity stunt quickly attracted many visitors including foreigners who flocked to the green hilly Bigogwe region of rural Rwanda to get a first-hand experience with the area’s cattle culture as well as enjoying hiking, milking and playing traditional games."

Telesphore Gashugi, president of Abaharanira Ubukire Gasagara farmers’ cooperative said that 10 people died contrary to previous reports that indicated that the victims were 11, while 45 others got injured as a result of the gruesome incident. He attributed the collapse of the shelter to the heavy weight of the maize on its wooden structure, as well as wind that shook it.

More than 30 others were critically injured, according to Rwanda National Police (RNP.). The injured were attended to by emergency health personnel and evacuated to medical facilities, according to the Office of the Prime Minister. When The New Times arrived at the scene, on Friday evening, much of Gasagara Cell was a scene of despair. Big heaps of harvested maize were abandoned on the ground and not stored in open-to-air structures. There was no much joy over the good harvest anymore. READ ALSO: PM Ngirente consoles victims of Rusororo tragic accident Prime Minister Edouard Ngirente on Friday, January 3, condoled with the grief-stricken families whose members passed on in the tragic accident. “The government will provide appropriate support to the bereaved families and the injured,” a statement by the Office of the Prime Minister read in part. Measures to ensure the safety of built structures will be reinforced to avoid similar incidents in the future, it added. According to Telesphore Gashugi, the president of Abaharanira Ubukire Gasagara farmers’ cooperative, it counted 76 members who farm on 12.5 hectares. Gashugi told The New Times that this year, the cooperative had registered a record-high harvest. But the farmers, instead of rejoicing for the good hervest, are now in shock. The loss of lives, and the pain inflicted on the many others who survived but are critically injured as a result of the fatal collapse of the maize shelter, hit them hard. The collapsing of the drying facility, Gashugi said, was attributable to the fact that it was overloaded with maize, which was aggravated by wind that shook it. “It collapsed, and we screamed and shouted, saying that we are perishing,” he said. His wife who was inside the shelter is one of those injured in the accident – as her legs were trapped when the structure collapsed. Gashugi was not hit as he was near the door, and easily escaped when the commotion started. He said that they called for help, and were able to remove the debris to rescue some people who were stuck. Unfortunately, he said 10 people died on the spot, while about 45 others got injured. Justin Munezerwa, another member of the cooperative, was among those who were inside the shelter, hanging maize. According to Munezerwa, about 300 people were at the facility. Every cooperative member had brought about four casual labourers to help them handle their large maize hervest, he said. The most affected people are those who were sitting inside while preparing the maize before they got displayed on the wooden structures, as well as those who were hanging the maize, because it was difficult for them to make their way out. “I was also hanging the maize to dry. But, when the shelter collapsed, I immediately ran and managed to escape mainly because I was near the exit,” he said. Meanwhile, Gashugi said the Government committed to supporting the bereaved families to cover costs related to the funeral services or burial of the deceased. Though not so sure, he said that it was expected that the victims could be laid to rest on Saturday or Sunday. Gashugi said they previously were used to harvesting between 48 and 50 tonnes of maize per season. But, this year, we would get 80 tonnes per season,” he said, attributing their good yield to increased fertiliser use, and quality seeds. Their maize drying shelter, he said, was built in 2019 at a cost of over Rwf5.8 million. He explained that it was made of intertwined wooden structure covered with iron sheets. It also had a pavement made of concrete, and a retaining wall. It was set up on a relatively sloping surface. Gashugi said that people who were most affected by its fall are those who were in the area towards the base of the slope as that is where most of the structure caved in."
33,RIB names 10 companies involved in white-collar crimes,https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/4566/news/women/leading-women-in-rwandas-banking-sector,"Over 10,000 Anglican global leaders who were irked by the Church of England’s recent support for the LGBTQ, are set to meet in Rwanda in April to forge a way forward about their ties with their English counterparts. An assembly held by the Church of England this week made several unprecedented moves in support of the LGBTQ, where for instance, the clerics voted to offer blessings to same-sex couples. The Church of England also said it is considering whether to stop referring to God as “he”, after priests asked to be allowed to use gender-neutral terms instead. A new commission on the way forward on the matter is set to be launched in a few months. In response to such moves, Revered Foley Beach, the Archbishop of the Anglican Church in North America, who is also the head of the Global Anglican Future Conference (GAFCON), an Anglican realignment movement, expressed disappointment, saying he will be meeting 1,1000 Anglican church leaders in Rwanda in April to “make a decision” about the Church of England. “The decision taken by the General Synod of the Church of England and the explanations given are clear indications that the Church of England is moving a step at a time to fully accept the practice of homosexuality as part of the life and practice of the English Church,” the statement read. “We have lived through this with other Western Anglican Provinces that continually wavered on the ‘faith once delivered’ (Jude 3) and now outright deny the doctrine of biblical anthropology regarding gender identity and moral behavior.” Bishop Beach added that the scriptures have been clear on human sexuality through the centuries, and the majority of Anglicans around the world have concluded the same, “and yet, now, the Church of England has authorized the blessing of sin and declared that sin is no longer sin.” “We shall now have to make a decision about the Church of England,” the statement declared. “In April the Gafcon Primates will be hosting over 1,100 participants in GAFCON IV in Kigali, Rwanda. In collaboration with the Global South Fellowship of Anglicans (GSFA), we shall have more to say and do about these matters. Please come, and we’ll make room at the table for you,” the statement read. The Anglican Church of Rwanda is one of the churches that has ties with the GAFCON movement which describes itself as “a global family of authentic Anglicans standing together to retain and restore the Bible to the heart of the Anglican Communion.” It is associated with some 85 million Christians in the worldwide Anglican Communion spread across 40 regional churches, known as Provinces. The New Times tried to reach out to the leaders of the Anglican church in Rwanda for their reaction concerning the Church of England’s recent moves, but all efforts were futile at the time of publication. Meanwhile, some churches are already starting to issue their reactions in regard to the Church of England’s move. Here for instance, the Anglican Church of Uganda released a detailed statement calling out the Church of England for changing the Biblical doctrine of marriage."

Speaking to The New Times, Felix Maringe, the university’s Vice Chancellor said that the delay arose from a statutory requirement by the Higher Education Council obliging Higher Learning Institutions to submit for verification all graduating students before they can be conferred upon their degrees. “University of Kigali is undergoing this process and upon completion which is expected in a very near future, a new date for graduation will be communicated to the students and other respective stakeholders,” said the Vice Chancellor. He added: “As a compliant entity, the University of Kigali since its inception has always held its graduation ceremonies after HEC’s complete verification and approval and will continue to do so.” Over 1,800 students from the private university were supposed to graduate in different disciplines and had earlier said that the graduation was called off without any reason given to them. Students who spoke to The New Times had earlier said the university did not communicate reasons for the postponement or give them the next date for graduation. One of the students, Charles Gakwerere who is also a former president of the students’ guild said, “I tried getting information on what happened since everything was ready, but no one gave me feedback.” The university last held its graduation in December 2021, where over 2,000 graduands were conferred upon their degrees in a highly attended ceremony held at Kigali Arena."

Among other aims, Rwanda has targets to eliminate poverty, from the 38 per cent rate in 2017. According to the Vision 2050 document, the overarching goals for this Vision include economic growth and prosperity. Here, Rwanda aspires to become an upper-middle income country by 2035, where the target is to realise a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of over $4,036 (over Rwf4.3 million based on the current exchange rates); and a high-income country by 2050, with GDP per capita of over $12,476 (over 13.4 million). Data from the International Monetary Fund indicate that Rwanda’s annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita was $912.74 (about Rwf985,000, based on the current exchange rates), as of 2022. The GDP targets imply that the average income per Rwandan will be over four times, and over 13 times the current one by 2035 and 2050, respectively. In an interview with The New Times, (TNT) Nicolas Rwaka, Director of Research at the Chancellery for Heroes, National Orders and Decorations of Honour (CHENO), talked about heroism and why it is important to the realisation of Vision 2050 targets, underscoring the role of unity, transparency to that end. Here are excerpts: TNT: Considering heroism in the context of Rwanda, what is its significance to the country? Rwaka: Heroism is among the great values that are important to the country’s existence and development. It contributed to building Rwanda since its creation, because a country without those who sacrifice their lives for it goes extinct. It is the heroic value that has been getting our country rid of calamities, because there were people who risked their lives for the benefit of the public. TNT: Rwanda seeks to become an upper-middle income country by 2035, and a high-income country by 2050. What role does heroism have in regards to achieving that target? Rwaka: The first contribution is through mindset change, because we instil heroism values in people with a view to change mentality in terms of behaviours, morals, and the way they act. Mindset change is needed to ensure that Rwandans move with the country’s vision, and help the Government to realise it. We will continue to teach them heroism, so that they are characterised by the value of being punctual, and deliver good service and quality work. As work is crucial to a person’s life, we also want the value of quality work. If we have Rwandans who work well, for the interests of the public. For the development of their country, we will be assured that we will have quality work in the Vision 2050. TNT: Corruption has been, and continues to be, a threat to inclusive development, as it deprives some people of their rights to crucial support, while allowing unfair benefits to others. How can heroism contribute to addressing such an issue towards Vision 2050 goal attainment? Rwaka: Among the values that we teach in heroism, there is avoiding all those vices that derail the country’s development, including corruption and injustice. This is the case because heroism is intended for the development of the country. Therefore, we shun anything that is against that. That is why we put in place continuous awareness campaigns, either through radio and television, and set up cultural and heroism clubs in primary and secondary schools, so that our children grow up espousing heroic values, doing what is right and steer clear of what is wrong or evil. A person who loves their country – as one of the values of heroism – cannot tolerate a situation where people take bribes, where injustice is committed against people, where people are oppressed, or people remain in poverty. In the Vision 2050, we want that heroism value and the unity of Rwandans reign among all the categories of Rwandans. TNT: Which is the area where caution should be exercised, or should be given attention so that the envisaged heroism goal is achieved? Rwaka: The first thing that should be given attention is relentless efforts in teaching and encouraging people to uphold the Rwandan culture, especially heroic values. The reason for this is that if this is not done, we might backslide. The second thing to focus on is the culture of recognising and rewarding those who performed heroic deeds. That is why the people on which we carry out research, there are those who get decorations of honour because of their great deeds. Indeed, that should be integrated in our culture in order to recognise what is right, and condemn the wrong, because what devastated Rwanda is that [some] people let the wrong reign. Even, the genocide against the Tutsi [in 1994] occurred because there were people who endorsed the evil, instead of standing up against it. What is most important is that Rwandans, especially the youth, should emulate the good example given by the national heroes who founded Rwanda, and built it, such that we are honouring them up to now because of their deeds. People should understand that they should serve their country instead of selfish interests. That would help Rwandans to make progress, and achieve the Vision 2050."

Rwf25 billion) to refugees and asylum seekers from Libya hosted in Rwanda. These refugees –mainly from the Horn of Africa countries –whose hopes to cross the Mediterranean Sea from Libya to Europe were cut short, are sheltered at the Emergency Transit Mechanism (ETM) centre in Gashora, Bugesera District. ALSO READ: Inside Gashora transit centre hosting refugees from Libya The centre was set up as a result of a tripartite agreement signed between the government of Rwanda, the African Union and the UNHCR. The centre can host a total of 700 refugees at once. Aissatou Ndiaye, UNHCR Country Representative, said the funding allows the organisation to provide a number of services including shelter, access to health, psychosocial support, and livelihood training for evacuees during the processing of their documents for resettlement to third countries. “The needs of asylum seekers and refugees trapped in Libya are immense. Through the ETM and the Government of Rwanda&#039;s support solutions are being found to bring them to safety...over the next years, we aim to support about 3,000 more people to find solutions to their plight.” Phillipe Habinshuti, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry in Charge of Emergency Management (MINEMA), noted that the government continues to provide a safe environment for refugees to enjoy their rights and dignified lives. “Efforts have been made to facilitate refugees into different socioeconomic integration in education, health, security, among others, which requires enough funding to support all the needs,” he said. Calvo Uyarra, EU Ambassador to Rwanda, said: “The ETM in Rwanda is a crucial life-saving initiative to evacuate people facing major threats and inhumane conditions in Libya to safety in Rwanda. It is a significant example of African solidarity.” “The additional funding for the next four years is a testament of the success that this initiative has achieved in the initial phase,” she added. This latest round of funding builds on an earlier support package of €12.5 million between 2019 and April 2022. At least 1,453 refugees from Libya have been hosted in Rwanda since September 2019, through 12 evacuation flights. Of these, 919 people departed to third countries for resettlement and other complementary legal pathways. The majority move to Canada, France, Norway, Sweden, among other countries. The next flight from Libya is planned for March 2023."
